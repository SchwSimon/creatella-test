### What should I do when I'm finished?

Please use Git and make regular commits while working on this app. After you have finished your work upload your app to a Github repo, and then send us an email with the link to that repo along with information about which features you have included in your solution.

### How is the exam graded?

We are looking for idiomatic use of javascript, and the ability to solve the problems with code that is clean and easy to read. Even though it's very small in scope, please show us how you would use the language and conventions to structure things in a clear and maintainable way.

Try to create a simple and elegant UI for this. You are free to use SASS or any other CSS pre-processor of your choice, but plain CSS is fine too.

### This looks like it will take a while and I'm pretty busy

You're right! With something open-ended like this you could easily spend a week polishing and getting it just right. We don't expect you to do this, and we'll do our best to make sure you're not disadvantaged by this.

When we grade this exam we're not giving you a "score out of 100" for how many features you complete. We're trying to get some insight into your process, to see the way you work. So, by all means, spend more time if you want to. But you are also free to leave certain features out and give a written explanation of how you would approach it. The best approach is to spend your time on the features that you think is the best way to show us your strengths and experience.
